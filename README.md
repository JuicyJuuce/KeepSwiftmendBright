# Keep Swiftmend Bright
World of Warcraft addon that keeps the Swiftmend ability on action bars and cooldown manager un-dimmed even when there is no ally with a HoT currently targeted.

Currently the addon also prevents Swiftmend from desaturating (turning black and white) when on cooldown. Leave a comment on Curseforge if you would like an option to disable that.

KNOWN BUGS:
- only one Swiftmend spell on all action bars will be brightened
